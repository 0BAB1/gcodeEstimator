V1.0 :
    - init
V1.1 :
    - Introduced Excel mode for output :
        - usage : lathe.interpret(line, excel_mode = True) and lathe.save_csv_data(excel_mode=True) (considering lathe = FanucLathe())
        - structure of a line in the new output : [Goperation, tool, Diameter, Vc, N, f, Vf (speed), distance, time, line number in code]
        - Vf and time are calculated from other params and formated for escel so time and Vf does NOT apear in clear when not opend in a spreadsheet.
        - if Vf is set in the code to be in mm/min and not mm/rev, Vc, N, and f will be set to zero in the line as it will NOT change Vf
        - G00 has D, Vc, N, Vf set to 0 for the same reason as above
        - if we use mm/rev mode but rev/min is set to constant, then Vc output will be 0 and so will be D (Diameter)
        - G71 / G72 : all parameters 0 execpt Vf (needs improvement later)
        - G74 : all parameters 0 execpt Vf (needs improvement later)
        - G76 : all parameters 0 execpt Vf (needs improvement later)
        - globally, is set to 0 all params that do NOT have impact on the program
    - Standard output mode :
        - line number in now at the end of the line
    -added an integrated method to make a CSV file
